        <div class="sie-term cell small-12 medium-6 large-6">
            <h3>Diversity</h3>
            <p>Individual differences (e.g., personality, learning styles, life experiences) and group/social differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, physical or cognitive abilities, as well as cultural, political, religious, or other affiliations) that can be engaged in the service of learning.</p>

        <div class="sie-term cell small-12 medium-6 large-6">
            <h3>Equity</h3>
            <p>Creating opportunities for equal access and success for historically underrepresented populations, such as racial and ethnic minority and low-income students, in three main areas:
                <ul>
                    <li>Representational equity: the proportional participation at all levels of an institution.</li>
                    <li>Resource equity: the distribution of educational resources in order to close equity gaps.</li>
                    <li>Equity-mindedness: the demonstration of an awareness of and willingness to address equity issues among institutional leaders and staff.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="sie-term cell small-12 medium-6 large-6">
            <h3>Inclusion</h3>
            <p>The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity—in people, in the curriculum, in the co-curriculum, and in communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical). This engagement with diversity has the potential to increase one’s awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within systems and institutions.</p>

        <div class="sie-term cell small-12 medium-6 large-6">
            <h3>Social Justice</h3>
            <p>Social justice is both a process and goal that sees to build community awareness of societal oppression and agency towards creating an inclusive society that is equitable. 
                <ul>
                    <li>This includes the full inclusion and participation of all people in every aspect of society, the fair distribution of resources, and a commitment to addressing and correcting systemic and structural power imbalance that benefits one social group identity at the expense of another. </li>
                    <li>Additionally, social justice seeks to actively address the dynamics of oppression, power, and privilege to co-create an environment where all are physically/psychologically safe and treated with respect. </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Sustainable inclusive excellences (SIE) seek to engage all members of the WPI community in the critical transformation efforts that blend diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into the full fabric of the institution.
